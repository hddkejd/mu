            <h2>Also known as the Ming Wall, or in Pinyin Chinese, "Wanli Changcheng", or in Wade-Giles romanization, 
                "Wan-li Ch'ang-ch'eng", which means the 10,000-Li Long Wall, the Great Wall of China is one of the most extensive 
                building construction projects ever taken. One of the World's Seven Wonders and a designated UNESCO World Heritage 
                site since 1987, it crosses the 9 Chinese provinces and municipalities of Liaoning, Hebei, Tianjin, Beijing, Inner 
                Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Gansu. 
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The Great Wall of China is essentially the result of a series of ancient fortifications that grew to become a single
                defense barrier under a decade-long project, adopted by China as a symbol of China and a popular tourist attraction 
                today. Initiated half a thousand years ago, it runs through northern China and southern Mongolia for some 4,500 miles
                or 7,300 km. The most-preserved piece of the wall runs east to west from Mount Hu near Dandong in south-eastern Liaoning
                to Jiayu Pass in the north-western Gansu. This part was built during the Ming dynasty, from 1368 to 1644. Other major
                fortification parts were constructed from the 7th to the 4th century BCE, with Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of
                united China, connecting many of the separate pieces in the 3rd century BCE, under the Qin dynasty.
                <br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Often tracing hills and mountain ridges in the Chinese countryside, a quarter of the wall is actually made of natural
                barriers, including rivers. Aside from a few ditches and moats, about seventy percent of the wall is human-made, having
                taken over two millenniums of construction for its ultimate reach, before today, with some sections gone or turned into
                ruins at the present day. As a major tourist attraction since the early 20th century, the sections near Beijing,
                especially at Badaling to the city's northwest, are the most-visited pieces of the wall today.

                    <h2>The construction of a "permanent defense system" started from north of the kingdom's
                        capital province under the state of Chu, about the 7th century BCE. Carrying the name,
                        the "Square Wall," it was completed over the next two decades, with other states following suit
                        Ending at the Yellow Sea, the existing river dikes, newly constructed bulwarks, and areas of impassable
                        mountain terrain make much of the dirt and stone wall in the state of Qi. Parts were built by Zhongshan
                        state to protect itself from the southwest Zhao and Qin states, while there were also two defensive
                        lines in the Wei state, located on both sides of the Yellow River. The Hexi Wall served as defense
                        from the Qin state and from the western nomads.
                        <br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Built under the rule of King Hui from 370 to 335 BCE, the wall also expanded from the Luo River's dikes
                        on the western border. Although some construction was more straightforward, such as the erection of the
                        northern and the southern walls by the Zhao state as a means of protection from the Wei state, other
                        pieces would change hands, and therefore, defense purposes. The Henan Wall was erected to defend the
                        capital of the Henan province, now known as Kaifeng, and the Han state rebuilt the Zheng state-built
                        wall upon taking over the former. The wall also ran from the southern Xiangyuan Cave set east of Mount
                        Hu to Guyang, which comprises the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

                    <h2>As a means of preservation following the reorganization by Shang Yang of the Qui in the mid-400 BCE that
                        ultimately empowered the state, led them to seek protection of their assets with a wall from Lintiao,
                        running north along the Liupan Mountains line, to the Yellow River. The Northern Wall and the Yishui
                        Wall were set up in the Yan state with the latter expanding from the dike of the Yi River. In 290 BCE
                        the Northern Wall continued along the Yan Mountains, all the way to the modern city of Liaoyang, as
                        the last segment of the wall-erection initiatives during the Warring States period. Upon unifying
                        China in 221 BCE, the first Qin emperor removed some of the fortifications to ease movement between
                        the states. He then linked the wall from Qin, Yan, and Zhao in a 214 BCE decade-long project,
                        the 10,000-Li Long Wall. Un-garrisoned after the Qin dynasty, the wall fell in disrepair.

                                with most of today's relics located on the Ming Dynasty Great Wall of 8,851 km or
                                5,500 miles long, built in the 15th and 16th centuries as a protection from Mongolia.
                                The ancient 2,300-some years old wall ranges from 15 to 30 feet (5 to 9 meters) in
                                height with regular towered intervals, used historically to watch and signal.
                                There is also a 13-foot- (4-meter-) wide roadway along some sections on

                         were used by garrison when sending out patrol and during counterattacks. Ramps made the passes accessible
                          for horses and for soldiers' ladders, while the inside parapet served to prevent people and horses from
                           falling off. For further protection, their facades were often ramparted with brick and stone, while dirt
                            and crushed stones were used as the filler. Crenellated, or designed to have battlements, the jugged
                             line was used simultaneously for view access and defense from the top.
