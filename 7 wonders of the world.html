      <h2>
        Over 2000 years ago, Greek travelers compiled a list of the most incredible marvels 
        they encountered, which would become famously known as The Seven Ancient Wonders of
        the World. However, with the Pyramids of Giza being the only original survivor,
        a Swiss organization decided to take matters into its own hands and update the list.
        In 2001, New7Wonders Foundation asked the public which places they thought were the
        world’s biggest wonders. After more than 100 million votes and deliberation between
        200 potential candidates, these seven became the victors.

    <h2>
      <a href="Colosseum.html">The Colosseum</a> in Rome, Italy, is the largest amphitheater built in human
      history and is composed mainly of concrete, limestone, and wood. Emperor
      Vespasian, who wanted a space for Romans to seek entertainment, ordered
      the construction. This construction began around 72 CE and was completed
      in 80 CE. The Colosseum, at 620 by 513 feet (189 by 156 meters), could
      seat up to 50,000 viewers. Most events in The Colosseum were violent in
      nature, largely consisting of gladiator fights, public executions, and
      animal hunts. Between gladiators, prisoners, slaves, convicts, and other
      entertainers, an estimated 400,000 people died during the 350 years in
      which The Colosseum hosted events. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site
      in 1980. Over 4 million people visit The Colosseum annually.

    <h2>
      In Northern China, <a href="Great Wall of China.html">the Great Wall of China</a> is one of the largest
      construction projects recorded in human history. Despite popular belief,
      the Great Wall cannot be seen by the naked eye from outer space. While
      estimates of its length vary, China’s National Administration of Cultural
      Heritage reports the wall to be an impressive 13,170 miles (21,195
      kilometers) long. Walking the entire wall nonstop would take approximately
      17 months! Some work on the wall dates back to the 7th century BCE,
      although the Ming Dynasty constructed the principal, most well-preserved
      parts between 1368 and 1644. Contrary to popular belief, the Great Wall of
      China is not a singular, connected wall. It actually consists of numerous
      walls, some parallel for stretches, accompanied by watch towers and
      platforms. China built the Great Wall to better protect its northern
      border, although its effectiveness is debated. The Great Wall has been a
      UNESCO World Heritage site since 1987. Today, over 10 million tourists
      visit the wall every year. Visitors can easily access it from Beijing.

      <a href="Petra.html">Petra</a>, Jordan, is an ancient city whose buildings are carved into pink,
      red, and white sandstone cliffs. It is one of the oldest existing cities
      in the world and stretches over 100 square miles (259 square kilometers).
      The Nabateans founded it in approximately the fourth century, chiseling
      temples, dwellings, and tombs in the stone. The Nabateans also had very
      advanced infrastructure, creating an impressive irrigation system of dams,
      canals, and reservoirs that provided water for over 30,000 participants in
      the otherwise arid zone. Some remnants of this irrigation system are still
      visible today. Visitors may recognize the ancient city from Indiana Jones
      and The Last Crusade, which filmed several scenes there. Petra became a
      UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985, and currently, around 900,000 people
      visit it annually.

    <h2>
      <a href="Machu Picchu.html">Machu Picchu</a> is an Incan ancient ruins site located in the Andes
      Mountains, near the city of Cusco, Peru. Built in approximately 1450 CE,
      the Incans used very impressive drystone techniques, snuggly fitting
      together jagged stones like jigsaw pieces. Thanks to this intricate
      building technique, many of the structures continue to stand to this day.
      Peruvian farmer Agustín Lizárraga was the first recorded individual to
      discover Machu Picchu in 1902. However, Herman Bingham brought it to the
      attention of the Western world in 1911 with his discovery of it. There are
      many theories about the reasons for Machu Picchu’s construction. Some
      scholars believe that Machu Picchu was a holy convent known as “Virgins of
      the Sun” for women who were dedicated to the Incan sun god, Inti. Other
      theories include the city being a royal retreat for the Emporer Pachacuti
      or being a trading hub or location to test new crops. In 1983, Machu
      Picchu became a UNESCO World Heritage site, and today, approximately 1.5
      million people visit it each year.

    <h2>
      Situated in Yucatan, Mexico, <a href="Chichen Itza.html">Chichén Itzá</a> was a city built by the Mayan
      people. The first settlements in the city began in approximately 435-600
      CE, while the city would become abandoned hundreds of years later in 1250
      CE. The Mayan tribe, Itzá, was responsible for many of the structures
      built in this city. The most well-known pyramid in Chichén Itza is El
      Castillo, a four-sided pyramid that is 185 feet (55.5 meters) wide and 78
      feet (24 meters) tall. Impressively, the pyramid has 365 steps, each step
      representing a day of the year. During the spring and fall equinoxes, a
      shadow forms on the temple’s north stairway, creating the illusion of a
      slithering serpent. Today, 26 ruins still stand in Chichén Itzá, and
      approximately 2.5 million people visit the site every year. Most visitors
      travel from Cancun or the Rivera Maya to see Chichén Itzá.

      Located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, <a href="Christ the Redeemer.html">Christ the Redeemer</a> is a massive,
      98-foot (30-meter) tall statue made of concrete and soapstone. It is the
      youngest of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Princess Isabel introduced
      the concept when she requested that an image of Jesus Christ be erected in
      1888, honoring Brazil's abolition of slavery. The Roman Catholic
      archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro re-proposed the idea in 1921, receiving
      approval from President Epitácio Pessoa shortly after. It opened to the
      public ten years later, in 1931. Around 2 million people visit the site
      every year.

    <h2>
      <a href="Taj Mahal.html">The Taj Mahal</a>, situated in Agra, India, is an impressive mausoleum
      considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings constructed by
      mankind and a key example of Islamic art. In 1632, Emperor Shah Jahān
      ordered it to be built in honor of his wife, who died during the
      childbirth of their 14th child. About 20,000 workers were involved in the
      construction process, which lasted until about 1648. The complex also
      included an expansive garden and a reflecting pool. The mausoleum consists
      of white marble and semiprecious stones that form intricate floral and
      geometric patterns. Shah Jahān additionally had the marble designed to
      have a pink tint in the morning and a gold tint in the moonlight. Jahān
      and his late wife, Mumtaz Mahal, were both buried in the building after.
      In 1983, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 7 to 8 million people
      visit the Taj Mahal every year.
